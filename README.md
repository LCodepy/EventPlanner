# Event Planner 📅✨
<br><br>
## Overview
This is a simple yet powerful **Event Planner** with a built-in **To-Do List ✅**, developed using **Python 🐍** and the **Pygame** module. The entire interface, including buttons and text fields, has been built from scratch. The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
<br><br>
## Features 🚀
- **Calendar View 📆**: Navigate through months and select dates.
- **To-Do List 📝**: Add, remove, and check off tasks.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separates concerns into Model, View, and Controller for better maintainability.

## Project Structure (MVC Architecture) 📂
The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

- **Model (`model.py`)**: Manages application data (calendar events, to-do list items, etc.).
- **View (`view.py`)**: Handles rendering UI elements like buttons and text fields.
- **Controller (`controller.py`)**: Manages user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
